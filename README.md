## Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

This guided project offers a comprehensive approach to building your own voice assistant, leveraging OpenAI and IBM Watson technologies. You'll learn to convert spoken words to text, process the text using OpenAI's GPT-3 model, and then convert the processed response back to speech for playback. The project equips you with the skills to create a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, alongside a robust back-end powered by Flask. By completing this project, you'll gain a deep understanding of voice assistants, acquire the skills to build AI-powered assistants with voice functionalities, and establish a strong foundation in web development using various technologies. Ultimately, you'll have a finished, full-stack application showcasing your newfound abilities.
